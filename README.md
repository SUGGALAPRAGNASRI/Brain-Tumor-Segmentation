# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation

<ul>
  
<li> In the field of medicine, Segmentation of a Brain Tumor is a compelling and critical aspect. </li>
<li> The main purpose of the brain tumor segmentation is to detect the scope and locale of a brain tumor which benefits to effective clinical treatment.</li>
<li> There are numerous techniques introduced for Brain Tumor Segmentation in deep learning like CNNs, U-Net, ResNet, and DenseNet, etc. </li>

<li> This ipynb file intends to demonstrate the algorithm for brain tumor segmentation using a modified U-Net using inception as Backbone.</li> 
<li> Due to variable shape or locale of occurrence, segmenting brain tumors from MRIs is one of the most arduous activity in image analysis in the field of medicine.</li>
<li> This paper provides a modification in U-Net that provides boost in the F1-Score and IoU score in segmenting brain tumor. </li>
